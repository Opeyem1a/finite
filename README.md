# Finite
Finite is the antithesis of the mindless scroll. The goal is to allow the usage of distracting websites, 
but in safe, limited ways - hence the name.

Finite prevents you from doom-scrolling or procrastinating on common distracting websites, but allows you 
to set a custom list of allowed url patterns that it will leave alone.

### Goals
- Practice JavaScript
- Practice creating a browser extension
- Try to limit my personal usage of distracting
